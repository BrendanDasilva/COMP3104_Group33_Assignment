I am currently taking the COMP 3104 DevOps course at George Brown College,
where I’m learning about the core concepts of DevOps,
including continuous integration and continuous delivery.
I’m gaining hands-on experience with tools like Docker, Jenkins, and Git,
and exploring the cultural aspects of collaboration between development and operations teams.
This course is helping me develop industry-relevant skills that
I can apply in real-world scenarios.

One key reason to choose a career in DevOps is the high demand for skilled professionals,
as organizations increasingly seek to improve efficiency and accelerate software delivery.
