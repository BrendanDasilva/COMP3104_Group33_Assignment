One good reason to learn DevOps is that it significantly accelerates the software
delivery process, allowing teams to release updates and new features faster.
This responsiveness can give organizations a competitive edge and enhance customer satisfaction.

Entry-level DevOps engineers typically earn between $70,000 and $90,000 annually,
depending on location and company.
